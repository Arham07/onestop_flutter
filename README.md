# üé® Design

- We choose Node.js & Express.js for building backend APIs and have used various npm packages.
- Followed [MVC (Model View Controller) Architecture](https://www.w3schools.in/mvc-architecture) for separtion of different components and scaling can be done easily and [best practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) on backend.
- Used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database which is a very popular No-SQL & scalable database in market.
- Followed proper [folder structure & best practices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flutter-file-structure/) to develop different components on application side.
- Why built separate backend service instead of integrating services like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) ?
    - Integrating Firebase SDK in Flutter causes the app to perform slow compared to directly making API requests to your server.
    - Also, now application & backend's code remain separated and development can be done easily, scaling application & backend side.
    - Most modern applications follow same practice of separating their different services.
- How Staging environment works ?
    - We have setup a CD pipeline on dev branch and with push, the changes are deployed on our staging server.
    - We perform proper testing for each release and then, merge dev into main branch for publishing our changes to production.

# üßõ Future Advancements
- Shift to Typescript instead of Javascript because of various advantages.
- Refactor existing code for various features.
- Integrated test-cases for future releases.
- Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger.
